# Mocking Testing

This is a test suite for testing different test cases using mocking techniques for the StudentProvider interface.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- JUnit
- Mockito (for Mockito mocking technique)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MockingTestSuite.git


2. **Import the project into your preferred Java IDE:**

   - Open your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
   - Import the project as a Maven project.

## Running the Tests

1. **Run the test cases:**

   - Open the test class containing the mock tests.
   - Right-click inside the file and select "Run" or "Run As" > "JUnit Test".

## Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1: Anonymous Class Mock**
   - Mocks the StudentProvider interface using an anonymous class.
   - Tests a specific scenario related to the functionality.
   - Asserts the expected behavior.

2. **Test Case 2: Separate Class Mock**
   - Mocks the StudentProvider interface using a separate class.
   - Tests another scenario related to the functionality.
   - Asserts the expected behavior.

3. **Test Case 3: Mockito Mock**
   - Mocks the StudentProvider interface using Mockito framework.
   - Tests a different scenario related to the functionality.
   - Asserts the expected behavior.

4. **Test Case 4: Anonymous Class Mock**
   - Mocks the StudentProvider interface using an anonymous class.
   - Tests another scenario related to the functionality.
   - Asserts the expected behavior.

5. **Test Case 5: Separate Class Mock**
   - Mocks the StudentProvider interface using a separate class.
   - Tests another scenario related to the functionality.
   - Asserts the expected behavior.

6. **Test Case 6: Mockito Mock**
   - Mocks the StudentProvider interface using Mockito framework.
   - Tests another scenario related to the functionality.
   - Asserts the expected behavior.

## Grading

- Each different test case: 1 point
- Each mocking technique used (anonymous class, separate class, Mockito): 1 point each
- Code or test code compilation: 1 point
